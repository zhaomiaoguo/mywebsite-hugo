### Principal Investigator

Dr. Zhaomiao (Walter) Guo leads INfrastructure Systems with Proactive, Intelligence, and Resilience Enhancement (INSPIRE) Lab<sup>*</sup> at the University of Central Florida. Dr.Guo is currently an Assistant Professor in the Department of Civil, Environmental, and Construction Engineering and hold a joint appointment with the Resilient, Intelligent and Sustainable Energy Systems(RISES) Cluster. Dr. Guo’s research centers around modeling and computational strategies for intelligent and resilient critical infrastructure systems, with applications in transportation and energy systems. His research was/is supported by government agencies, auto manufacturers and leading power suppliers.

<sup>*</sup>One fully funded Ph.D. positions in INSPIRE lab for Spring/Fall 2022. The research areas broadly relate to network modeling and optimization, with applications in smart city, cyber-physical systems, and transportation & power system interactions. The candidates are expected to have a strong background in operations research, data science and/or computer science. Experiences in transportation and/or power system are preferred. If interested, please send your resume to Dr. Guo at guo@ucf.edu.
