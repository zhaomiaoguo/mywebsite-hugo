### Abstract (150-200 word)

 With the widespread use of mobile computing devices in contemporary society, our trajectories in the physical space and virtual world are increasingly closely connected. Using the anonymous smartphone data, we can construct the communication network, mobility network, and attention network, and further analyze the data in the perspective of network science.
