The long-tail distribution can be quantified in primarily [three ways, see Newman 's paper here](http://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/0412004.pdf?origin=publication_detail):

- Power law distribution
- Zipf distribution
- Pareto distribution

Here, I talk about the Zipf distribution which assesses the relationship between rank order and Frequency (probability).

> Zipf's law now refers more generally to frequency distributions of "rank data," in which the relative frequency of the nth-ranked item is given by the Zeta distribution. from [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipf's_law)

## DGBD

In Gustavo Martínez-Mekler et al's [article](http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3adoi/10.1371/journal.pone.0004791), they proposed a discrete generalized beta distribution: $$f(r) = A(N+1-r)^b/r^a$$, where r is the rank, **N** is maximum value, A the normalization constant and (a, b) two fitting exponents.

It's interesting to find that [Wu and Zhang (2011)](http://journals.aps.org/pre/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevE.84.026113) adopt the DGBD distribution to quantify the online social systems. Basically, they are interested in accelerating growth in human online behaviors.

Deﬁning P as the number of active users in a day and T as the total activity generated by these users, they find a power law relationship between them $$T = P^\gamma$$. Given $$\gamma$$ larger than 1, there exists an accelerating growth phenomena in online systems (e.g., tagging, microblogging)

They denote the activity of a user in one day with t(r), in which r is the decreasing rank of the activity among all individual activities in the day. Thus the maximum value of r, $$r_{max}$$, equals population P. The DGBD model of individual activities is then

$$t(r) = A(P+1−r)^b r^a (a > 0,b > 0)$$

They introduced that a determines the activities of highly active users(corresponds to the exponent $$\alpha$$ in Zipf’s law), b determines the activities of the less active users. Using the DGBD, They can ﬁt the empirical curves with $$R^2$$ > 0.9.


Here I start with an empirical dataset. The Tweet of Milan city in December 2013. Basically, we know the language of each tweet. Thus we have the frequency of each language.


	freq = c(1116, 2067, 137 ,  124, 643,  2042, 55  ,47186,  7504, 1488, 211,   1608,  3517 , 7  , 896  ,  378, 17 ,3098, 164977  ,  601 ,  196, 637, 149 , 44,2 ,  1801, 882   , 636,5184,  1851,  776 ,   343   , 851, 33  ,4011,   209,  715 ,  937 , 20,   6922, 2028 , 23,  3045 , 16 , 334,  31 ,  2)

	lan = c("af","ar","bg","cs","da","de","el","en","es","et","fa","fi","fr","he","hr","hu","id","it","ja","ko","lt","lv","mk","ne","nl","no","pl","pt","ro","ru","sk","sl","so","sq","sv","sw","th","tl","tr","uk","und","ur","vi","zh-cn","zh-tw")

Thus, we can calculate the decreasing rank for each language.

	Rank = rank(-freq, ties.method = c("first") )
	data = data.frame(lan, freq, Rank)
	data$Probability = data$Freq/sum(data$Freq)

We can write a simple function to fit the rank ordered data and capture the distribution.

	get_dgbd = function(freq){
	  Rank = rank(-freq, ties.method = c("first") )
	  p = freq/sum(as.numeric(freq))
	  # get the log form
	  log.f = log(freq)
	  log.p = log(p)
	  log.rank = log(Rank)
	  log.inverse.rank = log(length(Rank)+1-Rank)

	  # linear regression of zifp: for probability
	  cozp=coef(lm(log.p~log.rank))
	  zipf.p = function(x) exp(cozp[[1]] + cozp[2]*log(x))

	  # linear regression of zifp: for frequency
	  cozf=coef(lm(log.f~log.rank))
	  zipf.f = function(x) exp(cozf[[1]] + cozf[2]*log(x))

	  # linear regression of dgbd: for probability
	  codp=coef(lm(log.p~log.inverse.rank + log.rank))
	  dgbd.p = function(x) exp(codp[[1]]+ codp[[2]]*log(length(x)+1-x) + codp[[3]]*log(x))

	  # linear regression of dgbd: for frequency
	  codf=coef(lm(log.f~log.inverse.rank + log.rank))
	  dgbd.f = function(x) exp(codf[[1]]+ codf[[2]]*log(length(x)+1-x) + codf[[3]]*log(x))
	  return(c(zipf.p, zipf.f, dgbd.p, dgbd.f))
	}

	zipf.p = get_dgbd(data$Freq)[[1]]
	zipf.f = get_dgbd(data$Freq)[[2]]
	dgbd.p = get_dgbd(data$Freq)[[3]]
	dgbd.f = get_dgbd(data$Freq)[[4]]


	plot(freq~Rank,log="xy", xlab = "Rank (log)", ylab = "Frequency (log)", data = data)
	curve(zipf.f, col="red", add = T, n = length(data$Rank))
	curve(dgbd.f, col="blue", add = T, n = length(data$Rank))

Remember to specify the length of values in 'curve'. About its importance, check [this post](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22446006/why-is-curve-so-different-from-lines-and-points-in-r) on stackoverflow.

Finally, we can plot it with ggplot2.

	require(ggplot2)
	P = ggplot(data=data, aes(x=Rank, y=Freq, label = Var1)) + geom_point() +
	  coord_trans(xtrans = "log10", ytrans = "log10")+
	  stat_function(fun = dgbd.f, n = length(Rank), colour = 'red', size = 1)+
	  geom_text(aes(label=Var1),hjust=1.5, vjust=0, angle = 45, size = 3)

	png(file = "./language_rank_order_distribution2.png",
	    width=8, height=5,
	    units="in", res=700)
	P
	dev.off()

## How to construct your model?

Using the DGBD model, we can fit the frequency-rank data almost perfectly. However, there are many other other forms of alternative equations. For example, there are Zipf-Manderbrot Model and [its modifications](http://statweb.stanford.edu/~owen/courses/306a/ZipfAndGutenberg.pdf), How to guarantee that which specific model is the right one? We need to:

- learn more about the underlying mechanisms.
- observe the patterns of the data

In the paper titled [Modeling bursts and heavy tails in human dynamics](http://www3.nd.edu/~networks/Publication%20Categories/03%20Journal%20Articles/Social%20Science/Modeling%20bursts_Phys.%20Rev.%20E%2073,%20036127%20(2006).pdf), Alexei Vázquez et al tried to propose two queuing models to explain the **value** of scaling parameter in the temporal patterns of human behaviors. They capture the temporal patterns with two measurements: interevent time $$\tau$$ and waiting times $$\tau_{w}$$.

The time between two consecutive events is called the interevent time, $$\tau$$; the waiting (or response) time, $$\tau_w$$, representing the amount of time a task waits on an individual’s priority list before being executed.

Assuming that **the tasks are executed independently from each other at a constant rate $$\lambda$$**, the time can be approximated by a Poisson process:

$$p(\tau) = \lambda e^{-\lambda \tau}$$ .

However, we know that in many human behaviors, the Poisson process fails to capture the burst phenomenon. The temporal patterns can be generally categorized into two classes:

- A. The $$\alpha$$= 1 universality class: Web browsing, email, and library datasets

- B. The $$\alpha$$=3/2 universality class: The correspondence of Einstein, Darwin, and Freud, which is characterized by **a power law decay** combined with **an exponential cutoff**.

$$p(\tau)\simeq \tau^{-3/2} e^{-\tau / \tau_{0}}$$.

in which $$\tau_0 = \frac{1}{\mu (1-\sqrt{\rho})}$$, and $$\rho = \lambda / \mu$$. Recall that $$\lambda$$ is the arrival rate of new task, and $$\mu$$ is the response rate , thus $$\rho$$ is the task/job/traffic intensity.

- Subcritical regime: When $$\rho$$ < 1, there are fewer job, and more queuing space.
- Critical regime: When $$\rho$$ = 1, arrival rate equals response rate
- Supercritical regime: When $$\rho$$ > 1, there are more job, and less queuing space.


However, they also find that the interevent time distribution between two consecutive transactions made by a stock broker. The distribution follows a power law with the exponential cutoff $$p(\tau)\simeq \tau^{-1.3} e^{-\tau / \tau_{0}}$$.
