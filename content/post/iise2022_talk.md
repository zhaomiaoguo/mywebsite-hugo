We will have three presentations at IISE Annual Conference 2022 at Seattle from May 21 to May 24, 2022. Sina will present the work, coauthored with Rakibul Alam and Dr. Guo, on multi-stage multi-agent charging infrastructure and distributed generators planning in coupled transportation and power systems.  Dr. Guo will present two of the works on the charging infrastructure planning for ride-sourcing systems (coauthored with Rakibul) and network modeling with en-route information updates for transportation systems (coauthored with Fatima).
