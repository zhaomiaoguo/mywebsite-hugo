I'm thrilled to receive the NSF CAREER Award this year. Especially thanks my mentors, students, and friends who have helped greatly to this achievement.

The topic of my CAREER proposal is on "A Decentralized Optimization Framework for Next-Gen Transportation and Power Systems with Large-scale Transportation Electrification", aiming to contribute to the efficiency, sustainability, and resilience of these two critical infrastructure systems leveraging electric vehicles. Look forward to broad collaboration and discussion on this topics.
