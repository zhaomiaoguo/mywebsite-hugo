# Project title.
title = "Distributed Reinforcement Learning for Optimal Speed Limit Control Over Network, sponsor: Safer-Sim"

# Project summary to display on homepage.
summary = "The goal is to optimize variable speed limit control (VSLC) strategies over network to improve both traffic safety and mobility. The proposed research will advance the current knowledge and practice of VSLC in three aspects. First, this research will enlarge the scope of VSLC from link足based to network足 based control to bring a new understanding about its system足level safety implications. Second, it will optimize the impact of VSLC using multi足objective learning approaches considering both safety and mobility. Third, distributed artificial intelligence approaches proposed in this research introduce new opportunities for network control effectiveness and scalability compared with traditional model/rule based approaches."
