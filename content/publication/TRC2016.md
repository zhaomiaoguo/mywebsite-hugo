# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "Most existing studies on EV charging infrastructure planning take a central plannerâ€™s perspective, by assuming that investment decision on charging facilities can be controlled by a single decision entity. In this paper, we establish modeling and computational meth- ods to support business-driven EV charging infrastructure investment planning problem, where the infrastructure system is shaped by collective actions of multiple decision entities who do not necessarily coordinate with each other. A network-based multi- agent optimization modeling framework is developed to simultaneously capture the selfish behaviors of individual investors and travelers and their interactions over a network struc- ture. To overcome computational difficulty imposed by non-convexity of the problem, we rely on recent theoretical development on variational convergence of bivariate functions to design a solution algorithm with analysis on its convergence properties. Numerical exper- iments are implemented to study the performance of proposed method and draw practical insights."
