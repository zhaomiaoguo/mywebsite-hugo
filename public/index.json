We investigate the residual values of PEVs and compare them with those of other vehicle powertrain technologies using the “true market value” data from Edmunds.com, and considering U.S. federal incentives. We define the adjusted retention rate as the ratio between resale value and the manufacturer’s suggested retail price, subtracting incentives. We develop statistical models to quantify the effects of powertrain technologies on residual value while controlling key factors, including vehicle size, brand, and market segments. We find that the long-range high-performance Tesla Model S holds value significantly better than any other vehicle type evaluated, including internal combustion engine vehicles. Hybrid electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles are comparable to one another. They hold slightly less value than internal combustion engine vehicles, but significantly more than short-range (","tags":[],"title":"RESIDUAL VALUE ANALYSIS OF PLUG-IN VEHICLES IN THE UNITED STATES","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":"","date":1536530074,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1536530074,"objectID":"ea4e0bc962466fb94d448047d95ffb3a","permalink":"https://zhaomiaoguo.github.io/post/informs2018_talk/","publishdate":"2018-09-09T17:54:34-04:00","relpermalink":"/post/informs2018_talk/","section":"post","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Dr. Guo will present his work, collaborating with Sandia National Labs and UC Davis, on evolvement of charging infrastructure in a competitive and stochastic market at INFORMs 2018 in Phoenix.","type":"post"},{"authors":["**Zhaomiao Guo**","Richard Chen","Neng Fan","Jean-Paul Watson"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1498885085,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1498885085,"objectID":"ddc3cc4906a42d4113882bfc49262e9e","permalink":"https://zhaomiaoguo.github.io/publication/tps2017/","publishdate":"2017-07-01T00:58:05-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/tps2017/","section":"publication","summary":"The N -1-1 contingency reliability criterion considers the consecutive loss of two components in a power system, with intervening time for system adjustments between the two losses. In this paper, we consider the problem of optimizing generation unit while ensuring the N -1-1 criterion. Due to the coupling of time pe- riods associated with consecutive component losses, the resulting problem yields a very large-scale mixed-integer linear optimization model. For efficient solution, we introduce a novel branch-and-cut algorithm using a temporally decomposed bilevel separation or- acle. The model and algorithm are assessed using multiple IEEE test systems, and a comprehensive analysis is performed to compare system performance across different contingency criteria. Compu- tational results demonstrate the value of considering intervening time for system adjustments in terms of total cost and system ro- bustness.","tags":[],"title":"Contingency-Constrained Unit Commitment With Intervening Time for System Adjustments","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Zhaomiao Guo**","Shunbo Lei","Ying Wang","Zhi Zhou","Yan Zhou"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1496293722,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1496293722,"objectID":"eb6f7b04ec6da4c14fe9239310c823e7","permalink":"https://zhaomiaoguo.github.io/publication/pes2017/","publishdate":"2017-06-01T01:08:42-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/pes2017/","section":"publication","summary":"Increasing remote-controlled switches (RCSs) in the distribution network enhances not only the restoration capability, but also the flexibility to cope with the uncertainties of renewable generation and variable loads through dynamic reconfiguration. However, the switching frequency remains a significant concern for system stability. In this paper, we investigate the potential benefits of reducing switching frequency by coordinating electric vehicles (EVs) with distribution network operation, considering EVs’ daily travel patterns and battery degradation cost. The problem is formulated as mixed-integer quadratic programming (MIQP). Testing our model on the IEEE 33-node test feeder, we find that EVs can potentially reduce the frequency of switching while maintaining desirable system performance. In addition, battery degradation cost, incurred by vehicle-to-grid (V2G) services, is only a small portion of the total system operational cost.","tags":[],"title":"Dynamic Distribution Network Reconfiguration Considering Travel Behaviors and Battery Degradation of Electric Vehicles","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Zhaomiao Guo**","Yueyue Fan"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1481000400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1481000400,"objectID":"5a805e7f921b471a6087af5845872851","permalink":"https://zhaomiaoguo.github.io/publication/nse2016/","publishdate":"2016-12-06T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/publication/nse2016/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper presents a mathematical model for analyzing long-term infras- tructure investment decisions in a deregulated electricity market, such as the case in the United States.

A network-based multi- agent optimization modeling framework is developed to simultaneously capture the selfish behaviors of individual investors and travelers and their interactions over a network struc- ture. To overcome computational difficulty imposed by non-convexity of the problem, we rely on recent theoretical development on variational convergence of bivariate functions to design a solution algorithm with analysis on its convergence properties.

Single-loop detector stations are still popular in highway traffic systems in practice. Although dual loop stations could generate more accurate speed estimation with event data, updating single loops to dual loops is costly. Most previous work, such as the g-factor method on speed estimation with a single-loop system, used aggregated data and assumed a known effec- tive vehicle length. However, those methods did not always produce good results, particularly in traffic transition phases. This paper proposes a new approach using event data and mode occupancy within a moving win- dow of variable length to estimate the effective vehicle length, or g-factor. Berkeley Highway Laboratory dual loop data with a 1-Hz update rate and 60-Hz information were used for algorithm validation and reliability tests. The speed estimated from the corrected dual loop data was used as the ground truth for comparison. Root mean square error was used to quantify the discrepancy. Results showed that the proposed approach generates very satisfactory speed estimations compared with estimations from dual loop stations. This algorithm can be run at the control-cabinet level, in which event data of an individual loop from a 170 or 2070 control- ler are available without the need of any hardware modification. These controllers have the processor capabilities to handle data in real time.","tags":[],"title":"Estimating Traffic Speed with Single Inductive Loop Event Data","type":"publication"}]
