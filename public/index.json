In this study, we focus on investigating the impacts of en-route locational information updates on the system-level safety and mobility considering adaptive routing of CAVs. We propose a novel two-stage stochastic traffic equilibrium model to characterize the equilibrium traffic patterns considering adaptive routing behavior when en-route traffic information is provided. The proposed methodology is tested using the Orlando transportation network with real traffic and accident data. Different I2V information sharing strategies are analyzed to better understand the impacts of information sharing locations of I2V on transportation network safety and mobility, through which we generate insights on the optimal design of traffic information sharing systems.","tags":[],"title":"System-level impacts of en-route information sharing considering adaptive routing","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Md Rakibul Alam","**Zhaomiao Guo**"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1670734253,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1670734253,"objectID":"ead12a1e634e469a0800acbc83fa695f","permalink":"https://zhaomiaoguo.github.io/publication/trc2022_alam/","publishdate":"2022-12-11T00:50:53-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/trc2022_alam/","section":"publication","summary":"Freight mileages have been significantly increasing over the past decade, accounting for 11% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Freight electrification and platooning are two promising technologies to mitigate the energy and environmental impacts of freight transportation. Effective coordination of charging and platooning are urgently needed to maximize the benefits of these two technologies, especially considering the current inadequate charging infrastructure, long charging duration, higher energy usage, and tight delivery schedules for long-haul electric freight vehicles (EFVs). In this study, we aim to co-optimize the platooning and charging strategies of EFVs. To achieve this goal, we developed a mixed-integer linear programming model to minimize the total system costs, including en-route charging cost, delivery delay cost, and hub charging cost. The proposed model was tested using a case study of a 595-mile Florida interstate highway route and solved by the state-of-the-art branch-and-cut algorithms, through which we demonstrated the effectiveness of using our model to identify the optimal charging and platooning schedules and quantify the spatial distribution of charging demand and platoon energy savings. We also performed sensitivity analyses to better understand the impacts of some critical factors, including the EFV models, charging station (CS) capacity, number of CSs, charging speed, and departure-time windows.","tags":[],"title":"Co-optimization of Charging Scheduling and Platooning for Long-haul Electric Freight Vehicles","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sina Baghali","**Zhaomiao Guo**","Wei Wei","Mohammad Shahidehpour"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1655701085,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1655701085,"objectID":"a777c0dff39cf2e83327b192698d09fe","permalink":"https://zhaomiaoguo.github.io/publication/tps2022/","publishdate":"2022-06-20T00:58:05-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/tps2022/","section":"publication","summary":"We investigate the potential effects of  electric vehicles (EVs) on reducing the load shedding in heavily loaded distribution systems (DSs).

Through descriptive and regression analyses, we characterize the distributions of key charging behavior indicators, including charging location, dwell time, and battery start state of charge(SOC), and quantify the impacts of closely related factors on these charging behaviors.  We find that: (1) PEVs are more likely to charge in the morning at multifamily commercial locations with a lower start SOC compared with single family residential locations; (2) Weekday and morning sessions are more likely to utilize workplace charging and have shorter dwell time compared with weekend and afternoon sessions; (3) Single family residential area and  \rev{locations with Levels 1/2 chargers} have a higher start SOC and longer dwell time compared with other locations and DC fast chargers (DCFCs).

We propose a framework of network-based multi-agent optimization problems with equilibrium constraints (N-MOPEC) to consider the decentralized decision making of stakeholders in transportation and energy systems. To solve the high-dimensional non-convex problem, we develop an efficient computational algorithm based on exact convex reformulation. Numerical studies are conducted to illustrate the effectiveness of our modeling and computational approach and to draw policy insights. The proposed modeling and computational strategies could provide a solid foundation for the future study of power system resilience with private EVs in coupled transportation and power networks.","tags":[],"title":"Impacts of Privately Owned Electric Vehicles on Distribution System Resilience: A Multi-agent Optimization Approach (Best Paper Award)","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1611723600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1611723600,"objectID":"e56853ac8e68547f09d3dfcceaafe21b","permalink":"https://zhaomiaoguo.github.io/project/reinforcement_learning/","publishdate":"2021-01-27T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/project/reinforcement_learning/","section":"project","summary":"The goal is to optimize variable speed limit control (VSLC) strategies over network to improve both traffic safety and mobility.

We propose a mixed integer programming model to optimally coordinate the charging/discharging of AEVs with DDNR, while satisfying AEVs' original travel plan. Numerical studies based on a test system overlaying the IEEE 33-node test feeder and Sioux Falls transportation network show that DDNR and AEV complement each other, which improves the operation of distribution system.

In this paper, we establish modeling and computational meth- ods to support business-driven EV charging infrastructure investment planning problem, where the infrastructure system is shaped by collective actions of multiple decision entities who do not necessarily coordinate with each other. A network-based multi- agent optimization modeling framework is developed to simultaneously capture the selfish behaviors of individual investors and travelers and their interactions over a network struc- ture. To overcome computational difficulty imposed by non-convexity of the problem, we rely on recent theoretical development on variational convergence of bivariate functions to design a solution algorithm with analysis on its convergence properties. Numerical exper- iments are implemented to study the performance of proposed method and draw practical insights.","tags":[],"title":"Infrastructure Planning for Fast Charging Stations in a Competitive Market","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Xiaoyun Lu","Pravin Varaiya","Roberto Horowitz","**Zhaomiao Guo**","Joe Palen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1325394728,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1325394728,"objectID":"4db7b28e336f31b25d0b39f2784c6309","permalink":"https://zhaomiaoguo.github.io/publication/trr2012/","publishdate":"2012-01-01T01:12:08-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/trr2012/","section":"publication","summary":"The estimation of traffic speed based on loop detector occupancy is a long-standing problem that is critical to traffic management and control. Single-loop detector stations are still popular in highway traffic systems in practice. Although dual loop stations could generate more accurate speed estimation with event data, updating single loops to dual loops is costly. Most previous work, such as the g-factor method on speed estimation with a single-loop system, used aggregated data and assumed a known effec- tive vehicle length. However, those methods did not always produce good results, particularly in traffic transition phases. This paper proposes a new approach using event data and mode occupancy within a moving win- dow of variable length to estimate the effective vehicle length, or g-factor. Berkeley Highway Laboratory dual loop data with a 1-Hz update rate and 60-Hz information were used for algorithm validation and reliability tests. The speed estimated from the corrected dual loop data was used as the ground truth for comparison. Root mean square error was used to quantify the discrepancy. Results showed that the proposed approach generates very satisfactory speed estimations compared with estimations from dual loop stations. This algorithm can be run at the control-cabinet level, in which event data of an individual loop from a 170 or 2070 control- ler are available without the need of any hardware modification. These controllers have the processor capabilities to handle data in real time.","tags":[],"title":"Estimating Traffic Speed with Single Inductive Loop Event Data","type":"publication"}]
