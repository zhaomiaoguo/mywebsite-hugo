      <description>Prior to joining UCF, Fatima worked as an educator for two years. She completed her undergraduate and master’s degree in Civil Engineering from Bangladesh University of Engineering &amp;amp; Technology (BUET). While studying in BUET, she focused on issues related to child road safety and car-following behavior in heterogeneous road traffic condition. Fatima has succeeded on extracting the vehicle trajectory of heterogeneous traffic stream using image processing which she further used on her master’s thesis.</description>
